# YARW: Yet Another Rsync for Windows

A native Windows implementation of rsync written in Rust, designed to provide efficient file synchronization on Windows systems. Neither f**king WSL nor Cygwin is required anymore.

## Overview

`YARW` is a ground-up reimplementation of the rsync file synchronization tool, specifically designed for Windows. While the original rsync is primarily available for Linux/Unix systems, this project brings the power of rsync's delta-transfer algorithm to Windows with full native support.

## Features

Simply type the following text to ChatGPT:

Yo GPT plz tell me all the features in this repo: https://github.com/ActiveTK/YARW
```

Note that we offer almost the same options as the original rsync provides, generally speaking.

## Setup

### From Releases (Recommended)

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ActiveTK/YARW/releases) and add to your PATH.

Currently it works as a stand-alone binary, as we don't provide options for installing (PR to implement installation is always welcome).

### From Raw Binary

Also, you can try up-to-date version using a raw binary file at `/bin/yarw.exe` auto-generated by github workflows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ActiveTK/YARW.git
./YARW/bin/yarw.exe
```

### From Source

Requirements:
- Rust 1.70 or later
- Windows 10/11

Build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ActiveTK/YARW.git
cd YARW
cargo build --release
```

## Quick Start

### Basic File Synchronization

```bash
# Sync a directory (recursive)
rsync -rv source/ destination/

# Archive mode (recursive + preserve links)
rsync -av source/ destination/

# Show progress during transfer
rsync -av --progress source/ destination/
```

### And more options

Should you have any questions, feel free to ask Gemini or Claude.
